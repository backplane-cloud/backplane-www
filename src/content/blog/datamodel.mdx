Understanding the Backplane data model is key to leveraging Backplane.

The table below shows the entity relationships.

### Data Hierarchy

| Scope        | Description                                                      |    Parent    | Budget Scope |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| Organisation | This is the root of your tenancy                                 |      -       |          Yes |
| Platform     | Contains many Products                                           | Organisation |          Yes |
| Product      | Contains one or many Apps                                        |   Platform   |          Yes |
| App          | App belongs to a single Cloud                                    |   Product    |            - |
| Environment  | Apps contain one or many environments depending on template used |     App      |            - |

### Organisations

- Organisations represent the highest level in the data model hierarchy. Organisations provide the context and logical container for Platforms, Products and Apps.

- Cloud Credentials are set at the Organisation level.

- All Users belong to a single Organisation.

- This is where an Organisation Budget is set.

### Platforms

- Platforms contain many Products.

- Platforms provide a governance boundary for Cost, Access and Policy data.

- Platforms will request and receive a budget allocation from the Organisation by raising a **Budget Request**.

CLI:
To add a new platform, first [Login](/login) e.g. `bp auth login -e user@backplane.cloud -p *****`

```js
bp platform add --displayname 'My new Platform'
```

### Products

- Products contain many Apps.

To add a new Product

```js
bp product add --displayname 'My new Product'
```

### Apps

- Apps are synonymous with environments, they represent the Cloud workload.

- For example: A product may contain an App based in GCP and an App based in Azure. Collectively, these Apps underpin the Product. This allows for multi cloud Products.

- Apps can have many environments.

tip
To add an App to an existing Product

```js
bp app add --displayname 'My new App' --cloud azure --template default
```

Multi Organisation and Specifying Platform and Product-level Cloud Credentials is on the [Roadmap](/roadmap)
