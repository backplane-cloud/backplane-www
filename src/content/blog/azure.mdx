#### Creating a Service Principal in Azure

To create credentials you'll need to create an App registration in Entra ID.

1. Go to Microsoft Entra ID, and under Manage in the left side menu, select App registrations.

2. Click on New Registration and provide a name (e.g. `backplane-api`) a name and click Register.

3. Take note of the Tenant ID and Client ID.

4. Create a new Client Secret, click on Add a certificate or secret, New client secret, type a description, set expiry and click Add. Make a note of the Secret Value.

5. Assign the Service Principal you created with Contributor permission at the Subscription scope.

#### Add Azure Credentials via CLI

```js
bp cloud azure add --id "<orgID>"
--tenantid "<tenant ID>"
--clientid "<client ID>"
--clientsecret "<Your Client Secret>"
--subscriptionid "<default subscription GUID>"
```

#### Note:

The Subscription ID is required in the MVP since App environments are provisioned as Resource Groups as opposed to Subscriptions. Subscription environments will be in a future release.
