Configuring Atlas hosted MongoDB

1. Go to MongoDB.com and click on [Try Free](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Complete the Sign up form and click on Create your Access account. You will receive an e-mail verification. Once verified, click continue.
3. Complete the form until you get to the section Deploy your database.
4. Select M0 - Free
5. Using the defaults, choose your underlying Cloud Provider and region and then click on Create Deployment

6. Create MongoDB user e.g. mongo-admin
7. Click Choose a connection method
8. Click on Connect to your application > Drivers
9. Copy connection string to `.env` file.

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://mongo-admin:<password>@cluster0.q4oeiru.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

10. Click on Review Setup Steps and then Done.

This will complete the setup of your MongoDB instance ready for Backplane API Server to connect to.

info
Copy the connection string to your `.env` file and ensure that the environment variable is called MONGO_URI

`MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://mongo-admin:<password>@cluster0.q4oeiru.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`

tip
Ensure your IP Address is allowed at the MongoDB end for your Development machine.

On the left-hand side menu under SECURITY, click on Network Access and add the respective IP addresses of your Cloud Provider or your Development machine.

For production you'll need to update this for the Cloud Provider. Example if hosted in Azure Web App, [Find Out Web App IP Addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-inbound-outbound-ips#find-outbound-ips)
