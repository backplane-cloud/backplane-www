## Problem Statement

> Cloud is complex, multi-cloud is more complex.

Large organisations are invariably finding themselves operating in a multi-cloud landscape. This is due to factors such as:

- Mergers & Acquisition
- Differentiating Features
- De-risking Vendor Lock-in

This leads to several challenges:

- Complexity of different APIs and billing
- Ensuring consistency in security policies and access controls
- High dependendancy of Subject Matter Expertise in several cloud platforms
- Increased governance Complexity
- Increased cloud integration time

## Solution

### Introducing Backplane

Backplane addresses these challenges by:

- Providing a single API as an interface to each Cloud Vendors API-
- Providing data heterogeneity so cost, access, policy data follows a consistent data-shape
- The API helps alleviates the burden of subject matter expertise for the cloud platforms
- Faster integration time (just a single API to learn)
